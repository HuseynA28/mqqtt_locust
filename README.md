# MQTT Locust Load Testing Script Documentation

## Introduction

The "mqtt_locust_test.py" script is a Python program designed to perform load testing on MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) brokers using the Locust load testing framework. This script simulates multiple MQTT clients publishing messages to a broker and measures the performance of the broker under load.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- Clone or download the script from the GitHub repository.

- Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install locust paho-mqtt


Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use the script, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the "mqtt_locust_test.py" script.

Run the script with the desired command-line arguments. For example:
locust -f mqtt_locust_test.py --topic "my/topic"

Open a web browser and navigate to the Locust web interface (by default, it's http://localhost:8089).

Configure the number of users (clients) and the hatch rate for your load test.

Start the load test from the web interface.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

- Clone or download the script from the GitHub repository.

- Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install locust paho-mqtt
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

To use the script, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the "mqtt_locust_test.py" script.

Run the script with the desired command-line arguments. For example:

bash
Copy code
locust -f mqtt_locust_test.py --topic "my/topic"
Open a web browser and navigate to the Locust web interface (by default, it's http://localhost:8089).

Configure the number of users (clients) and the hatch rate for your load test.

Start the load test from the web interface.

Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
Command-Line Arguments
--topic: Specify the MQTT topic to which clients send messages.
Script Structure <a name="script-structure"></a>
The script is structured into several sections:

Importing required libraries.
Initializing global variables.
Defining functions for MQTT message handling and topic customization.
Handling command-line arguments.
Defining the structure of MQTT messages.
Creating a TaskSet for publishing MQTT messages.
Creating the MQTTLocust class for load testing.
Configuring Locust tasks.
Handling MQTT connection, disconnection, and message publishing.
Running the load test using Locust.
Customization <a name="customization"></a>
You can customize the script by modifying the following parameters:

MQTT broker address (broker_address).
MQTT request type (REQUEST_TYPE).
Publish timeout (PUBLISH_TIMEOUT).
JSON data file ("data.json").
Message publishing frequency (wait_time in the TaskSet).
Running the Tests <a name="running-the-tests"></a>
Run the script using the locust command as described in the "Usage" section.

Configure the number of clients, hatch rate, and other test parameters via the Locust web interface.

Start the test from the web interface, and the script will simulate MQTT clients publishing messages to the broker.

Results and Reporting <a name="results-and-reporting"></a>
Locust provides real-time performance metrics and reporting through its web interface.

You can view various statistics such as response times, request rates, and failures.

Generate and save detailed reports for analysis.

Example Scenario <a name="example-scenario"></a>
Here's an example scenario:

You want to test the performance of an MQTT broker under load.

You have an MQTT topic, e.g., "my/topic", to which clients publish JSON data.

You run the script with the appropriate configuration and command-line arguments.

Using the Locust web interface, you simulate 100 clients with a hatch rate of 10 clients per second.

The script sends MQTT messages to the broker, measuring response times and other metrics.

You analyze the results to assess the broker's performance.

Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
